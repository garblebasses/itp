# final project proposal

I wanna make some gloopy goopy squelchy looking shit using p5.js [I remember you going over an alternative browser tool in class though, maybe that one's better?] and display it on a website

## resources

- I will use the [reference page on p5.js](https://p5js.org/reference/) and probably look at the [tutorials](https://p5js.org/tutorials/) too
- I will use [this very beginner friendly looking resource](https://thecodingtrain.com/), it does seem like it hosts a lot of its guides on youtube hopefully that's fine
- literally just googled p5.js shaders and found [this](https://itp-xstory.github.io/p5js-shaders/#/)

## overview [1 paragraph]

I really found the visual aspect of the midterm interesting, I wanted to try my hand at something a little more complex. I've been able to make goopy looking still images using visual art programs with their built in tools like gradation mapping and color blending options (multiply, burn, dodge, etc.). so I wanna try making something like that from scratch, I wanna try utilizing shaders and maybe being able to make it animated / interactive to a user's mouse position [or audio]. I vibe hard with slimy looking and sounding shit

## Will any work as part of this project overlap with any work you are doing outside of this class? For another class? Who is the professor in this class?

no

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

- it should be able to display on a website properly
- it should be look SQUELCHY
- it should be multicolored
- the code should work

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- it should be animated / be able to interact with external forces [ie a mouse or sound]
- it should look cool as fuck
- it should look intricate enough to be impressive [at least to me]

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- is procedural the right word??? whatever word describes it being able to be randomized, as in you can refresh the page / code and it won't be a clone of what you just had before. probably has to relate to shaders, I still don't know my terminology around these things even though I find them very interesting
- this is way far out, just an option, and I don't even know if it's possible. but if I decided to not make it react to noise, could I have it make its OWN noise alongside reaction to mouse input?

## Outline of steps WITH A SPECIFIC CALENDAR INCLUDING DATES

- by tuesday november 11th ==> create something in p5.js that looks generally like what I'm looking to achieve, even if it's just a still image, and be able to display it on a website
- by tuesday november 18th ==> flesh out visual side of things if the first draft looks non satisfactory, figure out animation, try to figure out user interaction with mouse moving / clicking [or sound]
- within tuesday november 25th - tuesday december 2nd ==> attempt to figure out how to use shaders on this if I can, and attempt to try and maybe have it generate its own noise???
