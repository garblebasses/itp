# BAND SITE
[link to kandy krush's site](https://ezramemphis.github.io/Kandy-Krush/)

## problems faced
things that needed extra research:
- text color shifting
- importing local fonts
- how to insert a hyperlink
- some things wouln't center align properly

## self assessment
I made the image with all of our faces and guided a lot of the color choices on the website, supplied some fonts, and contributed a vocal stem to the audio file hosted on the site. I also wrote my own bio

## assessment of others
- ezra ==> did almost all of the coding and formatting, as its hosted on his github. wrote his own bio
- mila ==> put together the audio file hosted on the site, wrote her own bio, initially suggested the band be hyperpop
- yu ==> made the pop cat gif, supplied the audio that plays when you click [and helped with the code for it], wrote his own bio
- we all came up with many different fleeting ideas as a whole
