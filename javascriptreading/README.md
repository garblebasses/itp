## JAVASCRIPT READING
### problems I faced
I don't think I have to document the problems I overcame in this file but I'm just gonna say I definitely did not spend like 15 minutes searching for where the reading was because I forgot that would neeeever happen
## 3 things I already knew and 3 things I learned
### chapter 1
- One thing I already knew was that converting numbers to binary is just converting the base 10 number into a base 2 number
- One thing I learned was extra quotes within quotes need backslashes preceeding them for them to not be treated as the end of a string

### chapter 2
- One thing I already knew was the function of bindings being things that hold values like numbers or strings, although I haven't heard them be called bindings before
- One thing I learned was the naming convention for bindings most commonly used is apparently 'firstSecondEtc' where the first word isn't capitalized while the rest are in the name of a binding. This really stuck out to me because this is the same style of capitalization that characters use for their online usernames in the webcomic Homestuck, which I feel like I can assume the author got that convention from this 

### chapter 3
- One thing I already knew was nothing honestly, I honestly think all of this chapter was new information for me
- One thing I learned was that functions listen to the bindings that are defined in its call rather than a global binding of the same name that was defined previously in the code
