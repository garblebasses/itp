# HAIKU HOMEWORK
I used Terminal to create a .aiff file of the haiku Tadpoles by Bill Baker
## I did this by:
#### 1. googling "fish haikus"
#### 2. clicking the [first result](https://www.poetrysoup.com/poems/haiku/fish)
#### 3. scrolling down and finding the haiku (it was the second result)
#### 4. navigating to the haiku folder in my github folder using the cd command in Terminal
I did forget all of the commands we went over in class, and had to go back to the [class repo](https://github.com/rdwrome/261fa25/tree/main/01Git%26Shell) to look them up, then I forgot I can't just skip to the haiku folder by typing `cd haiku` because that's what I tried first (and I'm now just realizing I could've just dragged the folder into the terminal window instead of sequentially typing individual commands for each enclosing folder)
#### 5. executing the command `say tadpoles in the stream, swimming zigzag everywhere, frogs are soon to be -o tadpoles.aiff`
for my first attempt I tried just plainly copy pasting the haiku from the site after the `say` command, but because of the way the site formatted the haiku with linebreaks, terminal only read out the first line and tried to interpret the first words of the other two lines as commands (which it didn't understand obviously) (I also realized I forgot to type the filename after the `-o` anyway)
#### 6. success!
## and YES I KNOW TADPOLES ARE AMPHIBIANS NOT FISH OK BUT LISTEN THEY'RE FISH IN SPIRIT AND IT'S NOT MY FAULT THIS HAIKU WAS PUT IN THE FISH CATEGORY!!!!!!!!
